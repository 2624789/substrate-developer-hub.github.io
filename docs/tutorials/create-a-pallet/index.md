## The Node Template

If you haven't already, you should complete the first two tutorials. The
[Create Your First Substrate Chain](../../tutorials/create-your-first-substrate-chain/) tutorial
will guide you through the process of setting up your development environment. The
[Add a Pallet to Your Runtime](../../tutorials/add-a-pallet) tutorial will introduce the FRAME
system for runtime development and guide you through the process of extending the capabilities of a
FRAME runtime by adding a pallet. If you're an experienced developer and wish to skip those
tutorials, you can clone the
[Node Template repository](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template) and
refer to the
[documentation for local development](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template#local-development).
